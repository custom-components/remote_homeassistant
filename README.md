# Remote Home-Assistant

_Component to link multiple Home-Assistant instances together._

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`remote_homeassistant` | Link multiple Home-Assistant instances together .

The main instance connects to the Websocket APIs of the remote instances (already enabled out of box), the connection options are specified via the `host`, `port`, and `secure` configuration parameters. If the remote instance requires an access token to connect (created on the Profile page), it can be set via the `access_token` parameter. To ignore SSL warnings in secure mode, set the `verify_ssl` parameter to false.

After the connection is completed, the remote states get populated into the master instance.
The entity ids can optionally be prefixed via the `entity_prefix` parameter.

The component keeps track which objects originate from which instance. Whenever a service is called on an object, the call gets forwarded to the particular remote instance.

When the connection to the remote instance is lost, all previously published states are removed again from the local state registry.

A possible use case for this is to be able to use different Z-Wave networks, on different Z-Wave sticks (with the second one possible running on another computer in a different location).


## Installation

This component *must* be installed on both the main and remote instance of Home Assistant

If you use HACS:

1. Click install.

Otherwise:

1. To use this plugin, copy the `remote_homeassistant` folder into your [custom_components folder](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_file_structure/#where-home-assistant-looks-for-integrations).


**Remote instance**

On the remote instance you also need to add this to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
remote_homeassistant:
  instances:
```

This is not needed on the main instance.

## Configuration 

### Web (Config flow)

1. Add a new Remote Home-Assistant integration

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote/master/img/setup.png" height="400"/>

2. Specify the connection details to the remote instance

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote/master/img/device.png" height="400"/>

You can generate an access token in the by logging into your remote instance, clicking on your user profile icon, and then selecting "Create Token" under "Long-Lived Access Tokens".

Check "Secure" if you want to connect via a secure (https/wss) connection

3. After the instance is added, you can configure additional Options by clicking the "Options" button.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote/master/img/options.png" height="200"/>

4. You can configure an optional prefix that gets prepended to all remote entities (if unsure, leave this blank).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote/master/img/step1.png" height="200"/>

Click "Submit" to proceed to the next step.

5. You can also define filters, that include/exclude specified entities or domains from the remote instance.

or via..

### YAML

To integrate `remote_homeassistant` into Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

Simple example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
remote_homeassistant:
  instances:
  - host: raspberrypi.local
```


Full example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
remote_homeassistant:
  instances:
  - host: localhost
    port: 8124
  - host: localhost
    port: 8125

    verify_ssl: false
    access_token: !secret access_token
    entity_prefix: "instance02_"

      above: 1000
    - entity_id: sensor.faulty_*_power
      unit_of_measurement: W
      below: 500
    subscribe_events:
    - state_changed
    - service_registered
    - zwave.network_ready
    - zwave.node_event
    load_components:
    - zwave

## Special notes 

### Missing Components

If you have remote domains (e.g. `switch`), that are not loaded on the main instance you need to list them under `load_components`, otherwise you'll get a `Call service failed` error.

E.g. on the master:

```
remote_homeassistant:
  instances:
  - host: 10.0.0.2
    load_components:
    - zwave
```

to enable all `zwave` services. This can also be configured via options under Configuration->Integrations.

### Proxy Services

Some components do not use entities to handle service calls, but handle the
service calls themselves. One such example is `hdmi_cec`. This becomes a
problem as it is not possible to forward the service calls properly. To work
around this limitation, it's possible to set up a *proxy service*.

A proxy service is registered like a new service on the master instance, but
it mirrors a service on the remote instance. When the proxy service is called
on the master, the mirrored service is called on the remote instance. Any
error is propagated back to the master. To distinguish proxy services from
regular services, a service prefix must be provided.

Example: If a proxy service is set up for `hdmi_cec.volume` with service
prefix `remote_`, a new service called `hdmi_cec.remote_volume` will be
registered on the master instance. When called, the actual call will be forwarded
to `hdmi_cec.volume` on the remote instance. The YAML config would
look like this:

```yaml
remote_homeassistant:
  instances:
  - host: 10.0.0.
    service_prefix: remote_
    services:
      - hdmi_cec.volume
```

This can also be set up via Options for the integration under
Configuration -> Integrations.
